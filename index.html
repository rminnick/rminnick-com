    <h1 id="hi-im-ryan">Hi, I’m <a href="https://keybase.io/ryanminnick">Ryan</a>.</h1>

<p>I'm a public sector technologist focused on how AI, data, and modern platforms are reshaping tax administration and government operations.</p>

<p>My work sits at the intersection of technology, policy, and real-world implementation—helping state and local tax agencies move from theory to practice across areas like artificial intelligence, emerging technology trends, data analytics, data safeguarding, cybersecurity, and platform modernization.</p>

<p>I currently work with <a href="http://taxadmin.org">Federation of Tax Administrators</a>, the national organization supporting principal tax agencies in all 50 states, Washington, D.C., and the cities of New York and Philadelphia. I also host <a href="https://rss.com/podcasts/taxbreaks">FTA Tax Breaks</a>, where we explore the people, ideas, and technologies shaping the future of tax administration.</p>

<p>Before that, I was a brand facilitator and lead project manager at a marketing agency, where I helped public, private, and non-profit organizations build stronger communities by creating compelling brands and memorable experiences.</p>

<p>Outside of work, my partner Mike and I are rescue dog dads and unapologetic theme park enthusiasts.</p>
