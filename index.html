<p><a href="https://linkedin.com/in/ryanminnick">At work</a>, I'm COO for the <a href="http://taxadmin.org">Federation of Tax Administrators</a>, the only national organization supporting the principal tax administration agencies in all 50 US states, Washington, D.C., and the cities of New York and Philadelphia.

<p>At home, I'm a rescue dog dad, IT help desk for my extended family, and theme park enthusiast.
